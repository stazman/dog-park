XXX IMPORTANT! DELETE THIS LINE AND THIS SECTION BEFORE YOU REVISE YOUR README AND SUBMIT YOUR FINAL PROJECT. THEY’RE JUST HERE FOR YOUR GENERAL REFERENCE AS YOU PLAN YOUR PROJECT XXX
 
The General Requirements and Game Requirements are shown below as a convenience. If you don’t already have a way to make sure you are satisfying all project requirements,this README.md file or copy/paste it somewhere else/print it. 


General Requirements

_____ - This is a solo project! (Just to clarify, you may do the same game as another student, but you may not work together.)

_____ - This game cannot be a game or assignment we've already done in class.

_____ - This game must run in a web browser.

_____ - This game must be tracked in Github, with a minimum of 10 commits.

_____ - Ideally, put your empty project up on Github on day one of development and aim for multiple commits per day.

_____ - This game must be deployed on Github Pages or another location.


Game Requirements

_____ - The game can be designed for 2 or more players (PvP) or for 1 player (PvE).

_____ - The second player in a PvP game can be a person or an AI. (In this case, think of "AI" as a logical pattern.)

_____ - For multi-player games, turns should switch appropriately between players

_____ - The game should be winnable, or it should keep score (or track player progress in a meaningful way).
 
_____ - When a player wins or loses, the game status and/or score should display visually to the player in a way that does not rely on console.logs or alerts.

_____ - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should be written in separate files.

_____ - Effort must be spent on styling and appearance.

_____ - The HTML code should use semantic tags.

_____ - The GitHub repository for your game should have a README.md that describes the inspiration for the game, explains the controls and how to play the game, lists the technologies used to build the game, and addresses any outstanding bugs or unfinished functionality.
